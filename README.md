**Sortable table component for Bootstrap 3 extending on default styles (CSS only).**

Variables are based on my own versions of Bootstrap so you might have to adjust $caret-width-base, $caret-width-large, $dropdown-caret-color to your use of Syntax (some Bootstrap Sass forks use camelCasing e.g. $caretWidthBase)
